# U-Develop-It

The "U-Develop-It" project serves as a hands-on example, demonstrating the creation of an SQL database and performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations through Express.js routes. This provides a practical understanding of how backend server technology interacts with databases to provide dynamic functionality for websites and web applications.
